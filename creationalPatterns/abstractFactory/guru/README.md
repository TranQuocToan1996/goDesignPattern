1. Abstract product interfaces (IE shoe, shirt) with make properties of product
2. Implementation Abstract product interfaces
3. Factory interface with make product method
4. Implementation Factory interface

Advantages:
You can be sure that the products youâ€™re getting from a factory are compatible with each other.
You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.
Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier to support.
Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.

Disadvantage:
The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.
